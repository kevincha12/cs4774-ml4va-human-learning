## About
An ML4VA project to classify food desert tracts in Virginia using census data. Food deserts are defined as low-income and low-access tracts, and while low-income is not difficult to predict, low-access tracts are much more difficult as it would require prior knowledge on when and where a supermarket would come ahead of time.

## Setup
Download the [2019 Food Access Research Atlas dataset](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/download-the-data) and the [PLACES Census Tract Data](https://data.cdc.gov/500-Cities-Places/PLACES-Census-Tract-Data-GIS-Friendly-Format-2021-/mb5y-ytti/about_data). Both are 2019 figures. Then run the associated Juypter Notebook. The datasets have not been included in this repository due to their size, but they are free access online.

## Contact
Contact hpb2gv@virginia.edu, rgq7yd@virginia.edu, and xxd8nb@virginia.edu with any questions regarding the project.
